Congratulations!  You seem to have stumbled upon something special: my little corner of the internet.

Unfortunately, this corner of the internet is a little dusty.  As such, there's not much here, save for a few cobwebs and possibly some (*gulp*) spiders (or search engine crawlers, take your pick).

Maybe I'll get something going eventually so things aren't so barren.

Until then, here's a picture of a kitten to complete your day:
